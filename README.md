# Trivia Game
### A trivia quiz game that utilizes JavaScript logic and jQuery HTML manipulation

#### 05/18/18 - Scott Johnson

## Project Goal
The Trivia Game demonstrates the use of the jQuery library to dynamically update HTML pages.  The user starts the game by clicking on the 'start' button at which time HTML elements on the page are hidden / revealed so that the user can move forward with the quiz questions.  The user's answer selections to the quesitons are captured via radio button data, and these answer selections are compared to an answer key to determine how many questions were answered correctly.  When the user clicks the 'finished' button (or they are stopped because the timer has decremented to zero) their results are revealed.

## Project Usefulness
This project incorporates jQuery learnings on how to correctly select and manipulate HTML elements within the DOM, as well as how to incorporate timers and input buttons.
